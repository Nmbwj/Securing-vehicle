The Scheduler library enables the Arduino link:https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-due[Due], link:https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-zero[Zero], and link:https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr1000-wifi[MKR1000] to run multiple functions at the same time. This allows tasks to happen without interrupting each other.
